- Download this reel using igram and put in premiere pro, match the guides for Screen Recording, subtiles and Face Recording.
- Match the audio levels for music and vocals, Vocals need to be very crisp and bassy like the sample.
- Use audacity to clear the voice and increase bass if needed, you can also use adobe podcast.
- Ensure the initial Title is properly visible with animation in the beginning. For visibility prefer using light text over dark background and dark text over light background.
- Ensure there is a progress bar just below the subtitles like in this sample.
- Ensure subtitles are in single line.
- Make video very crips and duration within 60 seconds. 
Make jump cuts in all the places to trim pauses, remove any filler words if required and remove unnecessary repeated statement from script. 
- If after doing everything and still the duration is exceeding 60 second then increase the video speed in premiere pro, this will damage the voice pitch so to increase the voice speed seperately use Audacity, this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNEPTA3peJU) tells how to increase speed of audio, export the audio with increased speed and use in premiere pro.
- Ensure the Face lips, PC screen and voice is in sync.
- [Music to be used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlzcHe_gusE)
- Please use Highlighting parts of screen, zooming, scroll, movements, perspectives while showing the PC screen to highlight the respective parts being discussed in the video.
- Have some light spill effects in cuts and other places.
- Use SFX where possible
- Use Safepallete png to ensure the main content is within the visible area of screen.

Chart patterns are distinct formations on a price chart of a financial-traded asset. There are many different types of chart patterns that are distinguished by a wide variety of unique features. When a chart pattern is confirmed, there is a high probability that a certain (upward/downward) price movement will occur in the near future. A chart pattern is not able to predict with certainty a future price movement, however, it can indicate a high-probable trend reversal or continuation. Chart patterns are very useful in confirming the indications of other [technical analysis](https://tradingcenter.org/index.php/train/technical-analysis-guide) tools such as MACD or RSI.

## Two Categories of Chart Patterns
There are two major pattern categories:

- **Reversal Patterns**: Signal the end of the current trend.
- **Continuation Patterns**: Signal that the price trend is likely to continue in the same direction.

## Conclusions and the Important Role of Trading Volume

- **Spot Patterns on high timeframes (Daily and higher)**: Patterns on high timeframes are more reliable than those on lower timeframes.
- **Volume is the key for validating any pattern**: Significant trading volume at critical points validates patterns and reduces the probability of fake patterns.
- **Chart patterns should not be used in isolation**: They should confirm indications from other tools such as MACD, Support/Resistance, and Fibonacci Retracement.
